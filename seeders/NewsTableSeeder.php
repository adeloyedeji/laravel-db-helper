It provides a nutritional breakdown of the cucumber and an in-depth look at its possible health benefits, how to incorporate more cucumber into your diet and any potential health risks of consuming cucumber. Possible health benefits of consuming cucumbers Consuming fruits and vegetables of all kinds has long been associated with a reduced risk of many adverse health conditions. Many studies have suggested that increasing consumption of plant foods like cucumber decreases the risk of obesity, diabetes, heart disease and overall mortality while promoting a healthy complexion, increased energy, and overall lower weight. 1. Hydration Made up of mostly water and full of important electrolytes, cucumber is a perfect food to have on hand during the hot summer months to prevent dehydration. Adding cucumber to water is a great way to increase water consumption as well. 2. Skin When used topically, cucumber has a cooling and soothing effect that decreases swelling, irritation and inflammation. Cucumber slices can be placed on the eyes to decrease morning puffiness or placed on the skin to alleviate and treatsunburn. 3. Bone health Low intakes of vitamin K have been associated with a higher risk for bone fracture. Adequate vitamin K consumption can be achieved by eating a proper intake of fruits and vegetables (one cup of cucumber provides 11% of your daily needs) and is important for improving calcium absorption essential for optimal bone health.1 4. Cancer As a member of the Cucurbitaceae family of plants, cucumbers contain high levels of nutrients known as cucurbitacins.Cucurbitacins are known to block the JAK-STAT and MAPK signaling pathways that are used by cancer cells to proliferate and survive. Cucumbers contain cucurbitacins A, B, C, D and E. 3,4 Due to these properties, a paper published in 2013 recommended that "preclinical and clinical studies using combined treatment composed of cucurbitacins and standard chemo-, immuno- and/or radio-therapies should be planned for."4 Nutritional breakdown of cucumber According to the USDA National Nutrient Database, 1 cup of raw sliced cucumber with peel (approximately 119 grams) contains 115 grams of water, 16 calories, 0.8 grams of protein, 0.2 grams of fat and 2.9 grams of carbohydrate (including 0.9 grams of fiber and 1.8 grams of sugar). One cup of cucumber provides 11% of vitamin K, 4% of vitamin C, magnesium, potassium and manganese and 2% of vitamin A, thiamin, riboflavin, B-6, folate, pantothenic acid, calcium, iron, phosphorus, zinc and copper needs for the day. Cucumbers also contain lignans, which research has shown may decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease as well as several types of cancer. How to incorporate more cucumber into your diet Cucumbers should be stored in the refrigerator for up to one week to maintain their freshness. Some cucumbers are treated with a wax coating after they are picked; do not wash these before storing but make sure to wash thoroughly or peel before consuming. Avoid cucumbers with ends that are shriveled or withered. Cucumber makes a great addition to any salad or sandwich. Cucumbers are best when consumed raw and have a mild taste and cool crunch that make them a great addition to any salad or sandwich. Try mixing sliced cucumbers, tomatoes and feta cheese for a Greek style side dish Jazz up your water by adding mint leaves and cucumber for a refreshing treat Slice cucumbers into thick slices and dip them in your favorite hummus.
